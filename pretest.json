      "question": "Which reagent is used to selectively precipitate nickel in gravimetric estimation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Oxalic acid",
        "b": "Dimethyl glyoxime",
        "c": "EDTA",
        "d": "Ammonium oxalate"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Oxalic acid is not selective for nickel precipitation.",
        "b": "Dimethyl glyoxime forms a red precipitate specifically with nickel ions, making it selective.",
        "c": "EDTA is a chelating agent, not used for precipitation in this method.",
        "d": "Ammonium oxalate is not commonly used for nickel gravimetric analysis."

    {
      "question": "What is the role of ammonia in the gravimetric estimation of nickel?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To dissolve the nickel complex",
        "b": "To adjust the temperature",
        "c": "To maintain the pH for chelation",
        "d": "To oxidize nickel ions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Ammonia does not primarily function to dissolve the complex.",
        "b": "Temperature adjustment is not the role of ammonia here.",
        "c": "Ammonia maintains an alkaline pH, facilitating nickel chelation with dimethyl glyoxime.",
        "d": "Ammonia does not act as an oxidizing agent in this context."

    {
      "question": "Why is it important to avoid adding a large excess of dimethyl glyoxime in this experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It forms complexes with water molecules",
        "b": "It may lead to precipitation of DMG itself",
        "c": "It causes the nickel complex to evaporate",
        "d": "It reduces the solubility of the nickel complex"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "DMG does not typically form stable complexes with water molecules.",
        "b": "Excess DMG can precipitate independently, interfering with accurate nickel estimation.",
        "c": "Nickel-DMG complex is not volatile; it does not evaporate.",
        "d": "Solubility of the complex is not significantly reduced by excess DMG."
