      "question": "In gravimetric analysis, which of the following is NOT a fundamental step?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Precipitation",
        "b": "Chromatographic separation",
        "c": "Filtration",
        "d": "Ignition and weighing"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Precipitation is a core step in gravimetric analysis.",
        "b": "Chromatographic separation is not part of gravimetric analysis; it's a separate technique.",
        "c": "Filtration is essential to isolate the precipitate.",
        "d": "Ignition and weighing are required to obtain accurate mass of the analyte."

      "question": "Which of the following conditions favors the formation of a pure and filterable nickel-dimethylglyoxime precipitate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Rapid addition of the reagent without stirring",
        "b": "Cold solution at pH below 5",
        "c": "Slow addition of reagent with heating and stirring",
        "d": "Strong acidic medium with vigorous shaking"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Rapid addition can cause poor crystal formation and co-precipitation.",
        "b": "Acidic conditions and low temperatures hinder proper complex formation.",
        "c": "Slow addition with heating and stirring enhances purity and filterability of the precipitate.",
        "d": "Acidic media and excessive agitation can result in poor precipitate quality."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
