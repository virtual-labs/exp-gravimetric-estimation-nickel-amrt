### Procedure

- The given nickel solution is made up to 100 mL in a standard measuring flask.
- 20 mL of solution is pipetted into a 250 mL beaker.
- About 5 mL 1:1 HCl is added and diluted to 150 mL.
- The solution is heated to 70–80&nbsp;&deg;C. 25 mL of 1% dimethyl glyoxime in alcohol is added, immediately followed by dilute ammonia solution dropwise until it strongly smells of ammonia.
- The solution containing the precipitate is heated in a water bath for 30 minutes.
- The precipitate is allowed to stand for an hour.
- Filter the solution through a previously weighed sintered glass crucible.
- The precipitate is washed with cold water to free chloride.
- The crucible is placed in a dry 100 mL beaker and heated in the air oven at 110–120&nbsp;&deg;C for 1 hour.
- It is cooled in a desiccator and weighed. Repeat drying until constant weight is obtained.


### Calculation:

<p>Mass of sintered glass crucible = <strong>a</strong> g</p>
<p>Mass of sintered glass crucible + nickel complex = <strong>b</strong> g</p>
<p>Mass of dimethyl glyoxime nickel complex = (<strong>b</strong> − <strong>a</strong>) g</p>
<p>288.69 g of nickel complex contains 58.69 g of nickel.</p>
Mass of nickel in (<strong>b</strong> − <strong>a</strong>) g of complex = 

$$\frac{58.69\times (b\times a)}{288.69}$$


Therefore, Mass of nickel in the whole of the given solution

$$\frac{58.69\times (b\times a)\times 5}{288.69}$$
